used when we have to make copy/clone of the existing object

if client has to do it 


Student s1 = new Student();
..
..
..



Student s2 = new Student();
s2.name = s1.name;
..
..
... n attributes to copy

rather push the responsibiity to the class itself

public interface Prototype {

    public Prototype clone();
}


public class Student {
    int age;
    String name;
    String address;
    ..
    ..
    ..
     public Student clone(){
        return new Student(age,name,address,..,..,..)
     }
}
