example : auction system / airport management system

bidders send bids to mediator and mediator notifies all bidderes but on two bidders communicate

no two planes communicate with each other but mediator coordinate their landings

--> componenets may go in and out at any time
    -->chat room participants
    -->
--> it makes no sense for them to have direct references to one another

--> so all components refer to central entity called mediator
