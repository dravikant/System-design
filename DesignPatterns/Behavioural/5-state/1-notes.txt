design vending machine 

there are finite states and each state allows only finite operations .. statewise operations

e.g. for vending machine

State                                   Operations

Idle state -->      Press Accept cash button

Accept cash -->     Insert coins
                    Select Product
                    Refund cash

Select Product -->  Dispense Product
                    Refund cash
                    return extra cash

Dispense Product --> Dispense Product


Similar example TV

OFF --> power on

ON  --> change volume
        change channel
        power off


Implementation
===============

Product (object) has a state


define state as an interface and it has all possible operations

then define the concrete states as classes implementing this interface

and then in each state only implement the ones which are allowed in the current state

and for the rest have a default behaviour or throw an exception




public interface State{

    public void 
}
